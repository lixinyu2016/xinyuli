<h2>Course Overview</h2>
This class is a graduate-level introduction to lattie-based cryptography. The lattices have significantly empowered modern cryptography by giving us (a) a basis for cryptosystems which are secure against quantum computers, (b) multiple breakthroughs in cryptographic primitives such as fully homomorphic encryption and signatures, attribute-based encryption, which are widely used in privacy-preserving machine learning. This course explores the various aspects of the lattices and their applications in cryptography. 

<p>There is no required textbook for this class â€” lectures, notes, and research papers are the main source of content. The following lecture notes and monograph from similar courses are very helpful: 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/CS294/lecturenotes.pdf">Lattices, Learning with Errors and Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>, by Vinod Vaikuntanathan.
<li><a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cpeikert/pubs/lattice-survey.pdf">A decade of lattice cryptography</a>, by Chris Peikert.
<li><a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2009/index.html">Lattices in Computer Science</a>, taught by Oded Regev at NYU.
</ul>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: There are no formal prerequisite classes. A previous course in cryptography is helpful but is not required. This course is mathematically rigorous, hence the mathematical maturity and comfort with linear algebraic notions are the most important pre-requisite, followed by courses in the theory of computation.


<h2>Course Requirements</h2>
It is expected that students taking this course are interested in potential research in this area and,
as such, none of the requirements will present a problem for anyone taking the class.
The requirements are:
<ul>
<li>Regular attendance and participation during lecture.
<li>Reading assigned references, which will be listed in advance of lecture.
<li>Finishing homework assignments (about 3), due approximately every three weeks. Collaboration and external sources are allowed and encouraged; see academic honesty policy for details. This will count for 40% of the grade.
<li>Scribing lecture notes (in latex) in small groups. This will count for 20% of the grade. The number of lectures to be scribed by each student will depend on how many students take the class.
<li>Conducting Research-oriented project and presentation. The projects do not need to be purely theoretical. This will count for 40% of the grade.
</ul>

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>   
You are free to discuss the problem sets with others. However, the actual writeup of your
assignments must be done ONLY by yourself (and without copying from notes or other
sources!). In addition, you must acknowledge your sources and the discussions in your submission.

Please read the <a href="http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/"> Academic Integrity Policy</a> for full details. If you are having trouble with the course, come speak to me!for full details. If you are having trouble with the course, come speak to me!
